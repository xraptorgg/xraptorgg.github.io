                Hi!
                I am a second year undergraduate Computer Science & Engineering student at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. I am exploring areas of Machine Learning, specially Deep Learning and Computer Vision and hope to make a positive impact on the daily lives of people.
                <br>
                <br>
                My areas of interest are Image Classification, Generative AI, 3D reconstructions, Object Detection. I am also fascinated by Recommender Systems, Reinforcement Learning and wish to play with them before I graduate.
                <div class = "imp-about-text">
                    I am actively seeking research opportunities in Computer Vision Labs in the upcoming summer.

                I am an incoming research intern at my university's Computer Vision lab supervised by Dr. A. Alice Nithya working on Medical Imaging. I am excited to start this opportunity and learn about state-of-the-art research and gain valuable experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                My goal is to pursue a career in Computer Vision research. I am looking forward to exploring research opportunities, where I can apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am also highly intrigued by Generative AI and aspire to learn more of its theoretical underpinnings and practical applications. It is an interesting field, I would love to do research in it and see what kind of cool things we can build with it!
